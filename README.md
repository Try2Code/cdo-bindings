# Cdo.{rb,py} - Use Ruby/Python to access the power of CDO

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Try2Code/cdo-bindings.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Try2Code/cdo-bindings)

Welcome to the scripting interfaces of [CDO](https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/wiki)!
This repository contains interfaces for [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org). If you are not sure, wether this is useful or not, please have a look at:
[Why the .... should I use this???](https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/wiki/Cdo%7Brbpy%7D#Why-the-)

## Installation

Releases are distributed via [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/cdo) and [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/cdo):

*  Ruby
```
    gem install cdo (--user-install)
```
*  Python
```
    pip install cdo (--user)
```

### Requirements

Cdo.{rb,py} requires a working CDO binary and Ruby 2.x or Python 2.7/3.x

Multi-dimensional arrays (numpy for python, narray for ruby) require addtional
netcdf-io modules. These are [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/io.html) or [python-netcdf4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netCDF4) for python and
[ruby-netcdf](https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby-netcdf) for ruby. Because scipy has some difficulties with netcdf, I strongly recommend python-netCDF4.

Thx to Alexander Winkler there is also an IO option for XArray.

## Usage

You can find a lot of examples in the unit tests for both languages. Here are the direct links to the [ruby tests](https://github.com/Try2Code/cdo-bindings/blob/master/ruby/test/test_cdo.rb) and the [python tests](https://github.com/Try2Code/cdo-bindings/blob/master/python/test/test_cdo.py).

The following describes the basic features for both languages

### Run operators

The Ruby module can be used directly after loading it. For python and ruby
class interfaces an instance has to be created first

```ruby
    cdo = Cdo.new   #ruby
```
```python
    cdo = Cdo()     #python
```

Please check the documentation for constructor paramaters. I try to have equal interfaces in both languages for all public methods.

#### Debugging

For debugging purpose, both interfaces provide a "debug" attribute. If it is set to a boolian true, the complete commands and the return values will be printed during execution

```ruby
    cdo.debug = true    #ruby
```
```python
    cdo.debug = True    #python
```

The default is false of cause.

#### File information
```ruby
    cdo.infov(input: ifile)        #ruby
    cdo.showlevels(input: ifile)

```
```python
    cdo.infov(input=ifile)         #python
    cdo.showlevels(input=ifile)
```

#### Operators with user defined regular output files
```ruby
    cdo.timmin(input: ifile ,output: ofile)       #ruby
```
```python
    cdo.timmin(input = ifile,output = ofile)      #python
```
By default the return value of each call is the name of the output files (no matter if its a temporary file or not)

#### Use temporary output files
```ruby
    tminFile = cdo.timmin(input: ifile)  #ruby
```
```python
    tminFile = cdo.timmin(input = ifile) #python
```

#### Operators with parameter
```ruby
    cdo.remap([gridfile,weightfile],input:   ifile, output: ofile)   #ruby
```
```python
    cdo.remap([gridfile,weightfile],input => ifile, output => ofile) #python
```

#### logging
```ruby
    cdo = Cdo.new(logging: true, logFile: 'cdo_commands.log') #ruby
```
```python
    cdo = Cdo(logging=True, logFile='cdo_commands.log')       #python
```

#### Set global CDO options
```ruby
    cdo.copy(input:  ifile, output:  ofile,options:  "-f nc4")     #ruby
```
```python
    cdo.copy(input = ifile, output = ofile,options = "-f nc4")     #python
```

#### Set environment variables
```ruby
    cdo.splitname(input: ifile.join(' '),
                  output: 'splitTag',
                  env: {'CDO_FILE_SUFFIX' => '.nc'}) #or
    cdo.env = {'CDO_FILE_SUFFIX' => '.nc'}
```
```python
    cdo.splitname(input = ' '.join(ifiles),
                  output =  'splitTag', 
                  env={"CDO_FILE_SUFFIX": ".nc"})   #or
    cdo.env = {'CDO_FILE_SUFFIX': '.nc'}
```

#### Return multi-dimension arrrays
```ruby
    t = cdo.fldmin(:input => ifile,:returnArray => true).var('T').get  #rb, version <  1.2.0
    t = cdo.fldmin(:input => ifile,:returnCdf => true).var('T').get    #rb, version >= 1.2.0
    t = cdo.fldmin(:input => ifile,:returnArray => 'T')                #rb, version >= 1.2.0
```
```python
    t = cdo.fldmin(input = ifile,returnArray = True).variables['T'][:] #py, version <  1.2.0
    t = cdo.fldmin(input = ifile,returnCdf = True).variables['T'][:]   #py, version >= 1.2.0
    t = cdo.fldmin(input = ifile,returnArray = 'T')                    #py, version >= 1.2.0
```

*) If you use scipy >= 0.14 as netcdf backend, you have to use following code
instead to avoid possible segmentation faults:
```python
    cdf = cdo.fldmin(input = ifile,returnCdf = True)
    temperatures = cdf.variables['T'][:]
```
More examples can be found in test/cdo-examples.rb and [on the
homepage](https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/wiki/Cdo%7Brbpy%7D)

### Avoid re-processing

If you do not want to re-compute files, you can set

*  the instance attribute 'forceOutput' to false: this will effect all later
   call of that instance **or**
*  the operator option 'forceOutput' to false: this will only effect this
   operator call of this instance

For more information, please have a look at the unit tests.

## Changelog
* next:
  - use CDOs new (1.9.4) ```--config``` option for implementing propper reflection about the binary
  - finally fix #16 (missing tempfile generation for more than one output streams)
* **1.3.6**: 
  - bugfix for non-finding the CDO binary on some systems
  - fix hasCdo (py)
  - add hasCdo (rb)
* **1.3.5**:
  - read/write support for XArray datasets - thx to @pinplex!
  - **drop ruby support for 1.9 and older**
  - **remove module interface from the ruby version**
* **1.3.3**:
  - return arrays/lists of output files, which are created by split* operators
    suggestion from Karl-Hermann Wieners :ocean:
    **NOTE**: __this is done by simple globbing! Any other files with the appropriate name will be included in the list!__
  - use [six](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six) for python2 and 3 compatibility (thanks to @jvegasbsc)
  - drop full support of CDO version older then 1.5.4: undocumented operators
    in these version will not be callable
  - new keyword for operators which write to stdout: autoSplit. When set, each
    line will be split with the given value of the keyword to avoid the need
    for manual splitting. Nested return arrays of (outer) size 1 are flattened.
    See #11, thx to @beatorizu

    name and a masked array wrt to its FillValues is returned
    contribution for python by Alex Loew

    contribution for python from Estanislao Gonzalez
  - autocompletion and built-in documentation through help() for interactive use
    contribution from Estanislao Gonzalez [python]

    array is returned
* **1.1.0** API change:
